# Overview

famflags is a CSS sprite set of country flags.

These days, if you can rely on decent Unicode/Emoji support, you should probably just use
[Emoji Flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Indicator_Symbol).

# How & History
If you want to just use the images, check the Downloads link. If you want
to build your own, clone the repository and run make.

Note that these flags are named using the ISO3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
where appropriate. A list of codes can be found on 
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
